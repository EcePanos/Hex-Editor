1. Compatibility

This program uses wxpython 2.8 for the release
2.7.2 of python (windows 64bit) and may not work
if any of the above is not installed correctly.


2. Operation

Synchronization of the 2 windows is done manually
-The first window (project1.py) displays the data of the file in Hex (hexadecimal)
-Any change you want to make before the file reaches the final
the format must be saved as hex1.txt
-After the above file is created, by tapping the Refresh button
 the 2nd window (project2.py) will display the data (with any
modifications) in ascii format. Again, every change must be saved
in a file named ascii1.txt
-After this file is created by tapping Refresh in the 1st window
the changes you made to the hexadecimal file will be passed.
-Whenever you want you can save your final file with
any name.

3. Frequently Asked Questions

-The changes I make do not go from one window to the other.

Answer:  There are 2 possible causes for the problem:

  

   1. You have saved the hex1.txt, ascii1.txt files out of the
folder of the program.

   2. The hexadecimal window recognizes the characters
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0, a, b, c, d, e, f and exclusively paired,
if you wrote something that is not recognized (or a pair that is not mapped to ascii) 
your changes will not be able to
be moved to the ascii window. Also, if the number of
characters on the hexadecimal window is not even, there may be missing
characters from the ascii window or that window may be
completely empty!

4.Troubleshooting

It is recommended when you close the program to delete the temporarily
files hex1, ascii1 so that you do not open the wrong file in
future use, if you accidentally press Refresh

The Refresh button does nothing unless the corresponding
temporary files described above (hex1.txt, ascii1.txt) exist.
